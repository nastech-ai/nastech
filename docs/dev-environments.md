# Dev Environments

This document covers the local environment manager in [`environments/environments.ts`](../environments/environments.ts).

## What `pnpm env:*` Does

- `pnpm env:new`: create a new isolated environment under `environments/data/envs/<name>`.
- `pnpm env:use <name>`: switch the current environment.
- `pnpm env:server`: run the server inside the current environment.
- `pnpm env:web`: run the web app inside the current environment.
- `pnpm env:cli`: run the CLI inside the current environment.

Each environment injects its own:

- `NASTECH_HOME_DIR`
- `NASTECH_SERVER_URL`
- `NASTECH_WEBAPP_URL`
- `NASTECH_PROJECT_DIR`
- Expo/server port settings
- dev auth values when seeded

Each fresh environment also gets a copied lightweight fixture project from
`environments/lab-rat-todo-project/` at `environments/data/envs/<name>/project`.

Current limitation: the lab-rat project is copied as plain files only. It does
not include git history yet, so provider tests that depend on realistic repo
history still need a later fixture upgrade.

## `pnpm env:cli` Is A Passthrough

`pnpm env:cli` forwards extra arguments directly to `nastech`.

Examples:

```bash
pnpm env:cli --help
pnpm env:cli codex
pnpm env:cli daemon status
pnpm env:cli daemon stop
pnpm env:cli daemon start
```

This is equivalent to sourcing the environment and running the CLI manually:

```bash
source environments/data/envs/<name>/env.sh
nastech daemon status
```

## Why `env:cli` Exists

It is a convenience wrapper for the current environment. It does not create or pick an environment on its own. It just:

1. Reads `environments/data/current.json`
2. Builds env vars for that environment
3. Launches the CLI with those vars applied

If you want a lower-level, shell-native workflow, use the generated env file directly:

```bash
source environments/data/envs/<name>/env.sh
nastech
```

## Restarting The Current Environment Daemon

Either of these now works:

```bash
pnpm env:cli daemon stop
pnpm env:cli daemon start
```

Or:

```bash
source environments/data/envs/<name>/env.sh
nastech daemon stop
nastech daemon start
```
